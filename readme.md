# Webprojects library

This app enables a user to store custom web application projects. A user can create, delete or edit a stored web application project. This is a fullstack web application that uses the javaScript library react.js for the frontend view, node and express.js for the backend and a json file to store the project data entered by a user. The json file acts as a makeshift database for the web application data entered by a user.
